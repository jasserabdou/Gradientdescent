# Gradient Descent

This code demonstrates a basic implementation of gradient descent to fit a linear model to random input and target data. It uses the NumPy library for numerical operations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to showcase how gradient descent can be used to iteratively optimize the parameters of a linear model to minimize the mean squared error loss between the predicted and target values.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and NumPy installed on your system.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `gradient_descent.py`).
3. Run the script. It will perform the following steps:
   - Generate random input and target data.
   - Initialize the weight and bias of the linear model.
   - Apply the gradient descent algorithm to update the model parameters.
   - Print the loss and model parameters for each training epoch.

## Code Explanation

- The `input_data` is randomly generated with a shape of (10, 1).
- The `target_data` is created by adding random noise to the linear relationship `2 * input_data`.
- The `gradient_descent` function calculates the gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters (weight and bias) and updates them.
- The training loop iterates over 400 epochs and performs the gradient descent step in each epoch.
- The model's predictions are calculated using the updated parameters.
- The mean squared error loss is calculated to assess the model's performance.
